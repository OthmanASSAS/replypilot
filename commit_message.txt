feat: Implement Site Analyzer MVP with comprehensive testing

This commit delivers the complete Site Analyzer MVP with robust testing infrastructure and documentation.

**Key Features:**
- ✅ API `/api/analyze` with Puppeteer web scraping
- ✅ Chrome local integration for optimal performance  
- ✅ Comprehensive validation (URL, email format)
- ✅ Error handling and graceful failure management

**Testing Excellence:**
- ✅ 21 unit tests passing (100% success rate)
- ✅ Vitest integration with proper Puppeteer mocking
- ✅ Helper functions testing (`isValidUrl`, `generateAnalysisId`)
- ✅ Resolved complex mocking issues with `vi.importMock()`

**Technical Improvements:**
- ✅ Separated helper functions to `src/lib/analyze-helpers.ts`
- ✅ Updated technical documentation in `TECHNICAL_SOLUTIONS.md`
- ✅ Enhanced changelog with MVP completion details
- ✅ Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns

**Quality Assurance:**
- ✅ All tests pass: API routes, helpers, and existing Prisma tests
- ✅ Documentation complete with patterns and best practices
- ✅ Ready for next development cycle (database integration)
- ✅ Production-ready error handling and validation

The foundation is solid for implementing database persistence and advanced features in the next sprint.
